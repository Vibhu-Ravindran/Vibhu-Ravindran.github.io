        <ul>
        <li>I am currently interested in using generalized symmetries and anomalies to understand condensed matter systems (specifically, 3+1 D topological phases) as well as the reverse direction: using concrete models to better understand general, often categorical structures that are used to describe these new symmetries. </li>
        <li>Previously I worked on various projects related to developing numerical tensor network algorithms for both 1D and 2D quantum systems. Though I don't want to work on algorithm development anymore, I maintain an interest in precisely characterizing entanglement in many body wavefunctions using tensor networks.</li>
        <li>In the future I hope to learn more about non-equilibrium phases, in particular Floquet physics. I also maintain a pipe dream that one day condensed matter physics will be able to give back to mathematics like mirror symmetry, enabling something like a computation of a previously unknown spectrum or stable homotopy group. </li>
