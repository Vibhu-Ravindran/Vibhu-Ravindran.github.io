        <ul>
        <li>Broadly, my research interests lie in the intersection of quantum information and condensed matter physics. </li>
        <li>I am currently interested in using generalized symmetries to understand condensed matter systems as well as the reverse direction: using concrete models to better understand general, often categorical structures that are used to describe these new symmetries. </li>
        <li>Previously I worked on various projects related to developing numerical tensor network algorithms for both 1D and 2D quantum systems. </li>
        <li>In the future I hope to learn more about non-equilibrium phenomena. </li>
